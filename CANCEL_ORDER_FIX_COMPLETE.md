# ✅ Cancel Order Button Fix - COMPLETE!

## 🎉 Issue Resolved!

The cancel order button is now visible and working correctly for **all eligible orders**, including those that haven't been shipped yet!

---

## 🐛 **What Was the Problem?**

### **Root Cause:**
The `canCancelOrder()` function was checking for `trackingData.docketNumber`, but:
- Orders in **ORDER_PLACED** status → ❌ No docket number
- Orders in **PROCESSING** status → ❌ No docket number
- Docket numbers are only assigned when orders are **SHIPPED**

This meant users couldn't see the cancel button for pre-shipment orders - the most important time to allow cancellations!

---

## ✅ **What Was Fixed?**

### **1. Frontend (TrackOrderPage.tsx)** ✅

**BEFORE:**
```typescript
const canCancelOrder = () => {
  return (
    trackingData.docketNumber &&  // ❌ Blocked pre-shipment orders!
    status !== "DELIVERED" &&
    status !== "CANCELLED" &&
    orderType === 'normal'
  );
};
```

**AFTER:**
```typescript
const canCancelOrder = () => {
  // Allow cancellation for normal orders that are not delivered or already cancelled
  // Docket number check removed - users can cancel before shipment (no docket yet)
  return (
    status !== "DELIVERED" &&
    status !== "CANCELLED" &&
    orderType === 'normal'
  );
};
```

**handleCancelShipment Updated:**
- Now sends `orderNumber` and `email` (always available)
- Sends `docketNumber` only if available (optional)
- Backend handles both cases

### **2. Backend (trackingController.ts)** ✅

**New Logic:**
```typescript
// Accept either docketNumber OR orderNumber+email
if (!reason || (!docketNumber && !(orderNumber && email))) {
  return error;
}

// Find order by docketNumber OR orderNumber+email
if (docketNumber) {
  // Find by docket number (shipped orders)
  trackingOrder = await TrackingOrder.findOne({ docketNumber });
} else if (orderNumber && email) {
  // Find by order number (pre-shipment orders)
  const user = await User.findOne({ email });
  const order = await OrderModel.findOne({ orderNumber, user: user._id });
  trackingOrder = await TrackingOrder.findOne({ order: order._id });
}

// Smart cancellation
if (trackingOrder.docketNumber) {
  // Order shipped - call Sequel247 API to cancel with courier
  await cancelShipmentWithCourier(docketNumber, reason);
} else {
  // Order not yet shipped - just update database status
  console.log('Order not yet shipped. Cancelling in database only.');
}

// Update database status
trackingOrder.status = OrderStatus.CANCELLED;
trackingOrder.addTrackingEvent(
  OrderStatus.CANCELLED,
  trackingOrder.docketNumber 
    ? 'Shipment cancelled with courier: reason' 
    : 'Order cancelled before shipment: reason'
);
```

## 🎯 **Cancellation Flow by Order State**

### **Pre-Shipment Orders (No Docket):**
```
User clicks "Cancel Order"
    ↓
Frontend sends: { orderNumber, email, reason }
    ↓
Backend finds order by orderNumber + email
    ↓
Backend checks: status, orderType
    ↓
✅ Updates database status to CANCELLED
    ↓
NO Sequel247 API call (order not shipped yet)
    ↓
User sees: "Order cancelled successfully!"
```

### **Shipped Orders (Has Docket):**
```
User clicks "Cancel Order"
    ↓
Frontend sends: { docketNumber, orderNumber, email, reason }
    ↓
Backend finds order by docketNumber
    ↓
Backend checks: status, orderType
    ↓
📞 Calls Sequel247 API to cancel with courier
    ↓
✅ Updates database status to CANCELLED
    ↓
User sees: "Shipment cancelled successfully!"
```
