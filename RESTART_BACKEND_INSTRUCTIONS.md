# 🔄 RESTART BACKEND SERVER

## ❗ IMPORTANT: Backend Must Be Restarted

The backend is using `ts-node` which **does not auto-reload** when code changes. You must manually restart it.

---

## 🛑 Step 1: Stop the Current Backend

In the terminal running `npm run dev` (server):

**Press:** `Ctrl + C` (twice if needed)

You should see the server stop.

---

## ▶️ Step 2: Start the Backend Again

```bash
cd server
npm run dev
```

Wait for:
```
✅ MongoDB connected
🚀 Server running on port 5000
```

---

## ✅ Step 3: Test the Track Order Page

1. Go to: http://localhost:5173/track-order
2. The order cards should auto-fill when clicked
3. Or manually enter:
   - **Order Number:** `KYNA-1761127659334-0UCP86`
   - **Email:** `tiwariaditya1810@gmail.com`
4. Click **"Track Order"**

**Expected:** Order details should load immediately (no more infinite loading!)

---

## 🐛 What Was Fixed

### Issue 1: Double Population Bug ❌
The `trackOrder` method was trying to populate the order **twice**:
1. Once in `findByOrderNumberAndEmail()` 
2. Again in `trackOrder()`

This caused the API to **timeout and hang**.

### Fix: Removed Duplicate Population ✅
```typescript
// BEFORE (caused timeout):
const trackingOrder = await TrackingOrder.findByOrderNumberAndEmail(...);
await trackingOrder.populate({ ... }); // ❌ DUPLICATE!

// AFTER (works):
const trackingOrder = await TrackingOrder.findByOrderNumberAndEmail(...);
// Already populated, no need to populate again ✅
```

## 📊 Watch Backend Logs

When you track an order, you should see:

```
🔍 findByOrderNumberAndEmail called:
   Order Number: KYNA-1761127659334-0UCP86
   Email: tiwariaditya1810@gmail.com
   ✅ User found: 68f7f452330878c13e49f6dc
   ✅ Order found: 68f8ad3ae45c0525508987ae
   ✅ Tracking order found: 68f8ad3ce45c0525508987b1
🔍 Building Tracking Response:
   Order Number: KYNA-1761127659334-0UCP86
   Order Type from TrackingOrder: normal
   Final Order Type: normal
   Status: ORDER_PLACED
```

## 🚨 If Still Not Working

### Check 1: Backend Terminal
- Is the server running?
- Any errors in red?
- See the debug logs above?

### Check 2: Browser Console (F12)
- Any errors in red?
- Check Network tab for `/api/tracking/track` request
- Should be Status 200 OK (not timeout)

### Check 3: Clear Browser Cache
```javascript
// In browser console:
localStorage.clear();
location.reload();
```

---

## ✅ Changes Made

1. ✅ Fixed case-insensitive order search
2. ✅ Removed double population bug
3. ✅ Added comprehensive debug logging
4. ✅ Fixed orderType resolution

**After restarting the backend, everything should work perfectly!** 🎉
